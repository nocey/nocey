# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Naci AytÄ±

## **Full Stack Developer** | ðŸš€ Building Scalable SaaS & High-Performance Microservices

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** specializing in architecting and deploying **enterprise-grade SaaS platforms** and **high-performance microservices**. My core focus is on delivering **measurable performance gains** (e.g., 40% faster app loads, 60% optimized database queries) and maintaining rigorous quality standards.

From a clean React/TypeScript frontend to a robust, containerized Go/Python backend, I love solving complex problems with clean architecture and modern development practices.

### ðŸŒŸ What Drives Me:

* **Obsessed with problem-solving**, clean architecture, and learning new tech.
* Experienced in data engineering, **automation scripts**, and exploring system internals.
* Thrive in collaborative teams where knowledge-sharing and growth are at the core.
* Specialized experience in **Bioinformatics** (IGV, genomic pipelines) and large data processing.

## âœ¨ Career Highlights & Measured Impact

My impact is consistently measured by performance and reliability:

* **Microservices:** Developed a high-performance **Go/Fiber** RESTful API microservice capable of handling **1000+ requests/second** with sub-$10ms$ latency.
* **Performance:** Reduced application load time by **$40\%$** and cut bundle size by **$60\%$** using code splitting, lazy loading, and **Million.js** optimization.
* **Database:** Optimized PostgreSQL query execution time by **$60\%$** by resolving N+1 issues and applying strategic indexing.
* **Big Data/Domain:** Engineered **ETL pipelines** for real-time processing of **30,000+ genomic data rows** and integrated the **IGV** viewer for complex data visualization.
* **Code Quality:** Led the migration of **$50+$ JavaScript modules to TypeScript** with strict mode, significantly improving code reliability and resolving critical compliance issues.
* **Desktop/Offline:** Built a cross-platform **Electron.js** application with an **offline-first** architecture (Drizzle ORM/SQLite) for local container management.
* **Testing:** Achieved and maintained **$85\%+$ test coverage** using **Vitest**, React Testing Library, and MSW within the GitLab CI pipeline.
